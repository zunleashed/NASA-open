Title: NGC 4651: The Umbrella Galaxy
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/UmbrellaGal_Alkuwari_3843.png
Explanation:
It's raining stars.
 What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy.
The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy's bright disk.
A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651.
The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years.
The featured deep image was captured in long exposures from Saudi Arabia.
The Umbrella Galaxy lies about 50 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed northern constellation of Berenice's Hair (Coma Berenices).

Title: Dark Sand Cascades on Mars
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/almosttrees_mro_2560.jpg
Explanation:
Are these trees growing on Mars? No.
 Groups of dark brown streaks have been photographed by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on melting pinkish sand dunes covered with light frost.
The featured image was taken in 2008 April near the North Pole of Mars.
At that time, dark sand on the interior of Martian sand dunes became more and more visible as the spring Sun melted the lighter carbon dioxide ice.
 When occurring near the top of a dune, dark sand may cascade down the dune leaving dark surface streaks -- streaks that might appear at first to be trees standing in front of the lighter regions but cast no shadows.
Objects about 25 centimeters across are resolved on this image spanning about one kilometer.
Close ups of some parts of this image show billowing plumes indicating that the sand slides were occurring even while the image was being taken.

Title: Lunar Farside
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/farside_lro1600.jpg
Explanation:
Tidally locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its familiar nearside to denizens of planet Earth.
From lunar orbit, the Moon's farside can become familiar, though.
In fact this sharp picture, a mosaic from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's wide angle camera, is centered on the lunar farside.
Part of a global mosaic of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011, the highest resolution version shows features at a scale of 100 meters per pixel.
Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the farside looks very different from the nearside covered with smooth dark lunar maria.
 A likely explanation is that the farside crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form dark, smooth maria..

Title: Messier 109
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M109_Robert_Eder.jpg
Explanation:
Big beautiful barred spiral galaxy Messier 109 is the 109th entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog of bright Nebulae and Star Clusters.
You can find it just below the Big Dipper's bowl in the northern constellation Ursa Major.
In fact, bright dipper star Phecda, Gamma Ursa Majoris, produces the glare at the upper right corner of this telescopic frame.
M109's prominent central bar gives the galaxy the appearance of the Greek letter "theta", θ, a common mathematical symbol representing an angle.
M109 spans a very small angle in planet Earth's sky though, about 7 arcminutes or 0.12 degrees.
But that small angle corresponds to an enormous 120,000 light-year diameter at the galaxy's estimated 60 million light-year distance.
The brightest member of the now recognized Ursa Major galaxy cluster, M109 (aka NGC 3992) is joined by spiky foreground stars.
Three small, fuzzy bluish galaxies also on the scene, identified (top to bottom) as UGC 6969, UGC 6940 and UGC 6923, are possibly satellite galaxies of the larger barred spiral galaxy Messier 109..

Title: The Seagull Nebula
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/IC2177SeagullLRGB-APOD2048.jpg
Explanation:
An interstellar expanse of glowing gas and obscuring dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker, the Seagull Nebula.
This broadband portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 3.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, in the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major).
The bright head of the Seagull Nebula is cataloged as IC 2177, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with embedded massive star HD 53367.
The larger emission region, encompassing objects with other catalog designations, is Likely part of an extensive shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions.
The notable bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris.
Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of interstellar gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula's estimated 3,800 light-year distance..

Title: Rubin's First Look: A Sagittarius Skyscape
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/SagittariusTrip_Rubin.png
Explanation:
This interstellar skyscape spans over 4 degrees across crowded starfields toward the constellation Sagittarius and the central Milky Way.
A First Look image captured at the new NSF–DOE Vera C.
Rubin Observatory, the bright nebulae and star clusters featured include famous stops on telescopic tours of the cosmos: Messier 8 and Messier 20.
An expansive star-forming region over a hundred light-years across, Messier 8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula.
About 4,000 light-years away the Lagoon Nebula harbors a remarkable cluster of young, massive stars.
Their intense radiation and stellar winds energize and agitate this cosmic lagoon's turbulent depths.
Messier 20's popular moniker is the Trifid.
Divided into three parts by dark interstellar dust lanes, the Trifid Nebula's glowing hydrogen gas creates its dominant red color.
But contrasting blue hues in the colorful Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight.
The Rubin Observatory visited the Trifid-Lagoon field to acquire all the image data during parts of four nights (May 1-4).
At full resolution, Rubin's magnificent Sagittarius skyscape is 84,000 pixels wide and 51,500 pixels tall..

Title: In the Center of Spiral Galaxy M61
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/M61_HubbleEsoGendler_2753.jpg
Explanation:
Is there a spiral galaxy in the center of this spiral galaxy? Sort of.
 Image data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Southern Observatory, and smaller telescopes on planet Earth are combined in this detailed portrait of face-on spiral galaxy Messier 61 (M61) and its bright center.
A mere 55 million light-years away in the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, M61 is also known as NGC 4303.
 It's considered to be an example of a barred spiral galaxy similar to our own Milky Way.
 Like other spiral galaxies, M61 also features sweeping spiral arms, cosmic dust lanes, pinkish star forming regions, and young blue star clusters.
 Its core houses an active supermassive black hole surrounded by a bright nuclear spiral -- infalling star-forming gas that itself looks like a separate spiral galaxy.

Title: W5: Pillars of Star Formation
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ic1848_WISEantonucci_1824.jpg
Explanation:
How do stars form? Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, later NEOWISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.
 A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.
 The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.
 In the featured scientifically colored infrared image, spectacular pillars left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas provide further visual clues.
W5 is also known as Westerhout 5 (W5) and IC 1848.
 Together with IC 1805, the nebulas form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas.
The featured image highlights a part of W5 spanning about 2,000 light years that is rich in star forming pillars.
 W5 lies about 6,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.

Title: A Berry Bowl of Martian Spherules
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/berrybowl_opportunity_960.jpg
Explanation:
How were these unusual Martian spherules created?  Thousands of unusual gray spherules made of iron and rock and dubbed blueberries were found embedded in and surrounding rocks near the landing site of the robot Opportunity rover on Mars in 2004.
 To help investigate their origin, Opportunity found a surface dubbed the Berry Bowl with an indentation that was rich in the Martian orbs.
 The Berry Bowl is pictured here, imaged during rover's 48th Martian day.
 The average size of a Martian blueberry rock is only about 4 millimeters across.
 By analyzing a circular patch in the rock surface to the left of the densest patch of spherules, Opportunity obtained data showing that the underlying rock has a much different composition than the hematite rich blueberries.
 This information contributes to the growing consensus that these small, strange, gray orbs were slowly deposited from a bath of dirty water.

Title: Two Worlds, Two Analemmas
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/AnalemmaEarthMars.jpg
Explanation:
Sure, that figure-8 shaped curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun in Earth's sky at the same time each day over one year is called an analemma.
On the left, Earth's figure-8 analemma was traced by combining wide-angle digital images recorded during the year from December 2011 through December 2012.
But the shape of an analemma depends on the eccentricity of a planet's orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation, so analemma curves can look different for different worlds.
Take Mars for example.
The Red Planet's axial tilt is similar to Earth's, but its orbit around the same sun is more eccentric (less circular) than Earth's orbit.
As seen from the Martian surface, the analemma traced in the right hand panel is shaped more like a tear drop.
The Mars rover Opportunity captured the images used over the Martian year corresponding to Earth dates July 2006 to June 2008.
Of course, each world's solstice dates still lie at the top and bottom of their different analemma curves.
The last Mars northern summer solstice was May 29, 2025.
Our fair planet's 2025 northern summer solstice is at June 21, 2:42 UTC..

Title: Major Lunar Standstill 2024-2025
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/MajorLunarStandstillAPOD.jpg
Explanation:
dmonton, Alberta, Canada, planet Earth lies on the horizon in this stack of panoramic composite images.
In a monthly time series arranged vertically top to bottom the ambitious photographic project follows the annual north-south swing of sunrise points, from June solstice to December solstice and back again.
It also follows the corresponding, but definitely harder to track, Full Moon rise.
Of course, the north-south swing of moonrise runs opposite sunrise along the horizon.
But these rising Full Moons also span a wider range on the horizon than the sunrises.
That's because the well-planned project (as shown in this video) covers the period June 2024 to June 2025, centered on a major lunar standstill.
Major lunar standstills represent extremes in the north-south range of moonrise driven by the 18.6 year precession period of the lunar orbit..

Title: NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/NGC3521-2048.jpg
Explanation:
Gorgeous spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is a mere 35 million light-years away, toward the northern springtime constellation Leo.
Relatively bright in planet Earth's sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65.
It's hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though.
Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars.
The deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells.
The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past..

What's that unusual spot on the Moon? It's the International Space Station.
Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon in 2019.
The featured image was taken from Palo Alto, California, USA with an exposure time of only 1/667 of a second.
In contrast, the duration of the transit of the ISS across the entire Moon was about half a second.
 A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.
 The bright crater Tycho is visible on the lower left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.

Explanation:
Can you find the Rosette Nebula? The red flowery-looking nebula just above the image center may seem a good choice, but that's not it.
 The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right, here colored blue and white, and connected to the other nebulas by gold-colored filaments.
 Because the featured image of Rosette's field is so wide, and because of its deep red exposure, it seems to contain other flowers.
 Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center.
 The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon.
This flowery field can be found toward the constellation of the Unicorn  (Monoceros).

Title: Two Worlds, One Sun
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/TwoWorldsOneSun_Bouic_2683.jpg
Explanation:
How different does sunset appear from Mars than from Earth? For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars.
These images were scaled to have the same angular width and are featured here side-by-side.
A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth.
This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth.
More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth.
The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust.
The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA's robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars.

Explanation:
In this Hubble Space Telescope image the bright, spiky stars lie in the foreground toward the heroic northern constellation Perseus and well within our own Milky Way galaxy.
In sharp focus beyond is UGC 2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant.
Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars.
That's about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way.
Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and American astronomer Vera Rubin's pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies.
Her work was the first to convincingly demonstrate the dominating presence of dark matter in our universe.

Title: Solar Eclipse

Explanation:
On April 20, 2023 the shadow of a New Moon raced across planet Earth's southern hemisphere.
When viewed along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the Moon in silhouette created a hybrid solar eclipse.
Hybrid eclipses are rare and can be seen as a total eclipse or an annular "ring of fire" eclipse depending on the observer's position.
Viewers of this much anticipated hybrid event were able to witness a total solar eclipse while anchored in the Indian Ocean near the centerline of the eclipse track off the coast of western Australia.
This ship-borne image from renowned eclipse chaser Fred Espenak captured the eclipsed Sun's magnificent outer atmosphere, or solar corona, streaming into space.
The composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, taken during the 62 seconds of totality, records an extended range of brightness to follow alluring details of the corona not quite visible to the eye.

Explanation:
Do you know the names of some of the brightest stars? It's likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language.
Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.
 In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.
 Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names.
Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius ("the scorcher" in Latin), Vega ("falling" in Arabic), and Antares ("rival to Mars" in Greek).
You are likely even familiar with the name of at least one star too dim to make this list: Polaris.

Title: Enceladus in True Color
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/EnceladusTrue_Cassini_960.jpg
Explanation:
Do oceans under the ice of Saturn's moon Enceladus contain life?  A reason to think so involves  long features -- some dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon's icy interior into space.
These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole and create  Saturn's mysterious E-ring.
 Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.
 Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown in true color from a close flyby.
 The deep crevasses are partly shadowed.
 Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead.
An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus.
These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus' surface could contain life.

Title: Between Scylla and Charybdis: A Double Cosmic Discovery
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/ScyllaB_LerouxGere_2094.jpg
Explanation:
Can you identify this celestial object?  Likely not — because this is a discovery image.
 Massive stars forge heavy elements in their cores and, after a few million years, end their lives in powerful supernova explosions.
These remnants cool relatively quickly and fade, making them difficult to detect.
 To uncover such faint, previously unknown supernova remnants, a dedicated group of amateur astrophotographers searched through sky surveys for possible supernova remnant candidates.
 The result: the first-ever image of supernova remnant G115.5+9.1 — named Scylla by its discoverers—glowing faintly in the constellation of the mythological King of Aethiopia: Cepheus.
 Emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red, and faint emission from oxygen is shown in hues of blue.
 Surprisingly, another discovery lurked to the upper right: a faint, previously unknown planetary nebula candidate.
In keeping with mythological tradition, it was named Charybdis (Sai 2) — a nod to the ancient Greek expression "caught between Scylla and Charybdis" from Homer’s Odyssey..

The central star is hidden from direct view by a torus of dust, but its energetic ultraviolet light ionizes atoms in the nebula.
In this sharp, telescopic view composed with narrowband image data, the ionized hydrogen and doubly ionized oxygen atoms are shown in their characteristic red and blue-green hues to reveal a stunning complex of knots and filaments within the nebula's wing-like bipolar outflows.

Is the sky the same every night? No -- the night sky changes every night in many ways.
To better explore how the night sky changes, the USA's NSF and DOE commissioned the Vera C.

Title: Rainbow Airglow over the Azores
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/GravityWaves_Claro_1486.jpg
Explanation:
Why would the sky glow like a giant repeating rainbow?  Airglow.
 Now, air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see.
A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth's atmosphere.
These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.
 The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.
 OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87 kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun.
The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.

Title: Veil Nebula: Wisps of an Ancient Supernova
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/VeilWide_Alharbi_5169.jpg
Explanation:
Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.
 About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova, leaving the Veil Nebula.
 At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.
 Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).
 The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.
 The featured picture was taken in Kuwait in mid-2024 and features light emitted by hydrogen in red and oxygen in blue.
 In deep images of the complete Veil Nebula like this, even studious readers might not be able to identify the iconic filaments.

Title: UGC 1810: Wildly Interacting Galaxy from Hubble
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2506/Arp273Main_HubblePestana_3079.jpg
Explanation:
What's happening to this spiral galaxy? Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor.
The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273.
The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions.
This ring's blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.
 The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.
 A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.
 Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.
 Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekick over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form..

Title: Mars in the Loop
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/Ma2024-5.jpg
Explanation:
This composite of images spaced a weather-permitting 5 to 9 days apart, from 2024 September 19 (top right) through 2025 May 18 (bottom left), faithfully traces ruddy-colored Mars as it makes a clockwise loop through the constellations Gemini and Cancer in planet Earth's night sky.
You can connect the dots and dates with your cursor over the image, but be sure to check out this animation of the Red Planet's 2024/25 retrograde motion.
Of course Mars didn't actually reverse the direction of its orbit.
Instead, the apparent backwards motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself.
Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.
 In this case Mars' apparent eastward motion began to reverse around December 8, when it seemed to linger near open star cluster M44 in Cancer.
After wandering back to the west, under Gemini's bright stars Castor and Pollux, Mars returned to pose near M44 by early May.
At its brightest near opposition on 2025 January 16, Mars was a mere 96 million kilometers away..

Title: Irregular Dwarf Galaxy Sextans A
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/sexa_gemsbock_cdk_pub.jpg
Explanation:
Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the attention, flaunting young, bright, blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along graceful, symmetric spiral arms.
But small galaxies form stars too, like irregular dwarf galaxy Sextans A.
Its young star clusters and star forming regions are gathered into a gumdrop-shaped region a mere 5,000 light-years across.
Seen toward the navigational constellation Sextans, the small galaxy lies some 4.5 million light-years distant.
That puts it near the outskirts of the local group of galaxies, that includes the large, massive spirals Andromeda and our own Milky Way.
Brighter Milky Way foreground stars appear spiky and yellowish in this colorful telescopic view of Sextans A..

Explanation:
This might look like a double-bladed lightsaber, but these two cosmic jets actually beam outward from a newborn star in a galaxy near you.
Constructed from Hubble Space Telescope image data, the stunning scene spans about half a light-year across Herbig-Haro 24 (HH 24), some 1,300 light-years or 400 parsecs away in the stellar nurseries of the Orion B molecular cloud complex.
Hidden from direct view, HH 24's central protostar is surrounded by cold dust and gas flattened into a rotating accretion disk.
As material from the disk falls toward the young stellar object, it heats up.
Opposing jets are blasted out along the system's rotation axis.
Cutting through the region's interstellar matter, the narrow, energetic jets produce a series of glowing shock fronts along their path..

Title: Spiral Galaxy NGC 2566 from Webb
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC2256_Webb_1280.jpg
Explanation:
What’s happening in the center of spiral galaxy NGC 2566? First, the eight rays that appear to be coming out of the center in the featured infrared image are not real — they are diffraction spikes caused by the mechanical structure of the Webb space telescope itself.
The center of NGC 2566 is bright but not considered unusual, which means that it likely contains a supermassive black hole, although currently not very active.
At only 76 million light years away, the light we see from NGC 2566 today left when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
The picturesque galaxy is close enough so that Earthly telescopes, including Webb and Hubble, can resolve the turbulent clouds of gas and dust where stars can form and so allows study of stellar evolution.
NGC 2566, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy, is notable for its bright central bar and its prominent outer spiral arms..

Explanation:
Jupiter is stranger than we knew.
NASA's Juno spacecraft has now completed over 70 swoops past Jupiter as it moves around its highly elliptical orbit.
Pictured from 2017, Jupiter is seen from below where, surprisingly, the horizontal bands that cover most of the planet disappear into swirls and complex patterns.
 A line of white oval clouds is visible nearer to the equator.
 Impressive results from Juno show that Jupiter's weather phenomena can extend deep below its cloud tops, that Jupiter's center has a core that is unexpectedly large and soft, and that Jupiter's magnetic field varies greatly with location.
 Although Juno is scheduled to keep orbiting Jupiter further into 2025, at some time the robotic spacecraft will be maneuvered to plunge into the giant planet.

Title: Deimos Before Sunrise
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/PIA26556_2048.jpg
Explanation:
Deimos takes 30 hours and 18 minutes to complete one orbit around the Red Planet.
That's a little more than one Martian day or sol which is about 24 hours and 40 minutes long, so Deimos drifts westward across the Martian sky.
About 15 kilometers across at its widest, the smallest of Mars' two moons is bright though.
In fact Deimos is the brightest celestial object in this Martian skyscape captured before sunrise by Perseverance on March 1, the 1,433rd sol of the Mars rover's mission.
The image is a composed of 16 exposures recorded by one of the rover's navigation cameras.
The individual exposures were combined into a single image for an enhanced low light view.
Regulus and Algieba, bright stars in the constellation Leo, are also visible in the dark Martian predawn sky..

Title: NGC 6366 vs 47 Ophiuchi
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/NGC6366_3500.jpg
Explanation:
Most globular star clusters roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy, but globular cluster NGC 6366 lies close to the galactic plane.
About 12,000 light-years away toward the constellation Ophiuchus, the cluster's starlight is dimmed and reddened by the Milky Way's interstellar dust when viewed from planet Earth.
As a result, the stars of NGC 6366 look almost golden in this telescopic scene, especially when seen next to relatively bright, bluish, and nearby star 47 Ophiuchi.
Compared to the hundred thousand stars or so gravitationally bound in distant NGC 6366, 47 Oph itself is a binary star system  a mere 100 light-years away.
Still, the co-orbiting stars of 47 Oph are too close together to be individually distinguished in the image..

Explanation:
A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky, Messier 63 is nearby, about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellation Canes Venatici.
Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way.
Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy.
This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint loops and curling star streams far into the galaxy's halo.
Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63.
Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63's star streams in the next few billion years..

Title: International Space Station Crosses the Sun
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/IssTransit_Sanz_2569.jpg
Explanation:
Typically, the International Space Station is visible only at night.
 Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.
 The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight.
The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun.
Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS's silhouette onto the background Sun.
The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Sant Feliu de Buixalleu, Spain with perfect timing.
 This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the active Sun which included several Sun's prominences around the edge.

Explanation:
This close-up from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern Acidalia Planitia.
A striking shade of blue in standard HiRISE image colors, to the human eye the area would probably look grey or a little reddish.
But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the sci-fi novel, "The Martian," by Andy Weir.
The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site, corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame.
For scale, Watney's 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater.

Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, but definitely not one of the least.
About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way.
M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown.

This shadowy landscape of majestic mountains and icy plains stretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world.
It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers when New Horizons looked back toward Pluto, 15 minutes after the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14, 2015.
The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right.
Layers of Pluto's tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view.
With a strangely familiar appearance, the frigid terrain likely includes ices of nitrogen and carbon monoxide with water-ice mountains rising up to 3,500 meters (11,000 feet).
That's comparable in height to the majestic mountains of planet Earth.

Explanation:
This pretty nebula lies some 1,500 light-years away, its shape and color in this telescopic view reminiscent of a robin's egg.
The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax).
Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn't represent a beginning, though.
Instead, it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star.
In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.
 Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud.
The blue-green hue inside of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.

Explanation:
How do black holes create X-rays? Answering this long-standing question was significantly advanced recently with data taken by NASA’s IXPE satellite.
X-rays cannot exit a black hole, but they can be created in the energetic environment nearby, in particular by a jet of particles moving outward.
By observing X-ray light arriving from near the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy BL Lac, called a blazar, it was discovered that these X-rays lacked significant polarization, which is expected when created more by energetic electrons than protons.
In the featured artistic illustration, a powerful jet is depicted emanating from an orange-colored accretion disk circling the black hole.

 But M81 left M82 with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.

Explanation:
If one black hole looks strange, what about two? Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this detailed computer visualization.
 The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole.
 For these masses, though, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet.
 The video allows us to see both sides of each black hole at the same time.
 Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon sphere, near their event horizons.
 In the past decade, gravitational waves from black hole collisions have actually been detected, although the coalescence of supermassive black holes remains undiscovered.

Explanation:
What’s causing those lines? Objects in the sky sometimes appear reflected as lines across water — but why? If the water’s surface is smooth, then reflected objects would appear similarly -- as spots.
But if the water is choppy, then there are many places where light from the object can reflect off the water and still come to you -- and so together form, typically, a line.
The same effect is frequently seen for the Sun just before sunset and just after sunrise.
Pictured about 10 days ago in Ibiza, Spain, images of the rising Moon, Venus (top), and Saturn (right, faint) were captured both directly and in line-reflected forms from the Mediterranean Sea.

Title: Spin up of a Supermassive Black Hole
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/blackholedisk_cfa_1080.jpg
Explanation:
How fast can a black hole spin?  If any object made of regular matter spins too fast -- it breaks apart.
But a black hole might not be able to break apart -- and its maximum spin rate is really unknown.
Theorists usually model rapidly rotating black holes with the Kerr solution to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which predicts several amazing and unusual things.
 Perhaps its most easily testable prediction, though, is that matter entering a maximally rotating black hole should be last seen orbiting at near the speed of light, as seen from far away.
This prediction was tested by NASA's NuSTAR and ESA's XMM satellites by observing the supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 1365.
The near light-speed limit was confirmed by measuring the heating and spectral line broadening of nuclear emissions at the inner edge of the surrounding accretion disk.
Pictured here is an artist's illustration depicting an accretion disk of normal matter swirling around a black hole, with a jet emanating from the top.
Since matter randomly falling into the black hole should not spin up a black hole this much, the NuSTAR and XMM measurements also validate the existence of the  surrounding accretion disk.

Title: Titan: Moon over Saturn
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/PIA19642Titan.jpg
Explanation:
Like Earth's moon, Saturn's largest moon Titan is locked in synchronous rotation with its planet.
This mosaic of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side always facing away from the ringed gas giant.
The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only solar system world besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of liquid rain and evaporation.
Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn's rings and cloud tops.
Near center is the dark dune-filled region known as Shangri-La.

Title: Young Star Cluster NGC 346
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/jwst-ngc346.png
Explanation:
The most massive young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud is NGC 346, embedded in our small satellite galaxy's largest star forming region some 210,000 light-years distant.
Of course the massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very energetic.
 Their winds and radiation sculpt the edges of the region's dusty molecular cloud triggering star-formation within.
The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars.
A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster.
This spectacular infrared view of NGC 346 is from the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRcam.
Emission from atomic hydrogen ionized by the massive stars' energetic radiation as well as molecular hydrogen and dust in the star-forming molecular cloud is detailed in pink and orange hues.
Webb's sharp image of the young star-forming region spans 240 light-years at the distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud..

Title: MESSENGER's Last Day on Mercury
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2505/messengerImpactSite_black.jpg
Explanation:
The first to orbit inner planet Mercury, the MESSENGER spacecraft came to rest on this region of Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015.
Constructed from MESSENGER image and laser altimeter data, the projected scene looks north over the northeastern rim of the broad, lava filled Shakespeare basin.
The large, 48 kilometer (30 mile) wide crater Janacek is near the upper left edge.
Terrain height is color coded with red regions about 3 kilometers above blue ones.
MESSENGER'S final orbit was predicted to end near the center, with the spacecraft impacting the surface at nearly 4 kilometers per second (over 8,700 miles per hour) and creating a new crater about 16 meters (52 feet) in diameter.
The impact on the far side of Mercury was not observed by telescopes, but confirmed when no signal was detected from the spacecraft given time to emerge from behind the planet.
Launched in 2004, the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemisty and Ranging spacecraft completed over 4,000 orbits after reaching the Solar System's innermost planet in 2011..

Explanation:
Sometimes, the sky itself seems to smile.
 A few days ago, visible over much of the world, an unusual superposition of our Moon with the planets Venus and Saturn created just such an iconic facial expression.
Specifically, a crescent Moon appeared to make a happy face on the night sky when paired with seemingly nearby planets.
 Pictured is the scene as it appeared over Zacatecas, México, with distinctive Bufa Hill in the foreground.

Title: Saturn's Rings Appear to Disappear
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/SaturnSeasons_Fontes_960.jpg
Explanation:
Where are Saturn's ears? Galileo is credited, in 1610, as the first person to see Saturn's rings.
Testing out Lipperhey's recently co-invented telescope, Galileo did not know what they were and so called them "ears".
 The mystery deepened in 1612, when Saturn's ears mysteriously disappeared.
Today we know exactly what happened: from the perspective of the Earth, Saturn's rings had become too thin to see.
 The same drama plays out every 15 years because Saturn, like Earth, undergoes tilt-driven seasons.
This means that as Saturn goes around the Sun, its equator and rings can tilt noticeably toward the Sun and inner Solar System, making them easily visible, but from other orbital locations will appear almost not at all.
 The featured picture from Brasilia, Brazil shows a modern version of this sequence: the top ring-dominated image was taken in 2020, while the bottom ring-obscure image taken earlier in 2025.

Title: Gum 37 and the Southern Tadpoles
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Gum37Hoo_Bozon_4863.jpg
Explanation:
This cosmic skyscape features glowing gas and dark dust clouds alongside the young stars of NGC 3572.
 A beautiful emission nebula and star cluster, it sails far southern skies within the nautical constellation Carina.
 Stars from NGC 3572 are toward top center in the telescopic frame that would measure about 100 light-years across at the cluster's estimated distance of 9,000 light-years.
 The visible interstellar gas and dust, shown in colors of the Hubble palette, is part of the star cluster's natal molecular cloud, itself cataloged as Gum 37.
Dense streamers of material within the nebula, eroded by stellar winds and radiation, clearly trail away from the energetic young stars.
 They are likely sites of ongoing star formation with shapes reminiscent of the Tadpoles of IC 410 -- better known to northern skygazers.
 In the coming tens to hundreds of millions of years, gas and stars in the cluster will be dispersed though, by gravitational tides and by violent supernova explosions that end the short lives of the massive cluster stars..

Title: IC 418: The Spirograph Nebula
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/Spirograph_Hubble_2119.jpg
Explanation:
What is creating the strange texture of IC 418?  Dubbed the Spirograph Nebula for its resemblance to drawings from a cyclical drawing tool, planetary nebula IC 418 shows patterns that are not well understood.
Perhaps they are related to chaotic winds from the variable central star, which changes brightness unpredictably in just a few hours.
 By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, IC 418 was probably a well-understood star similar to our Sun.
 Only a few thousand years ago, IC 418 was probably a common red giant star.
 Since running out of nuclear fuel, though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white-dwarf star, visible in the image center.
The light from the central core excites surrounding atoms in the nebula causing them to glow.
IC 418 lies about 2000 light-years away and spans 0.3 light-years across.

Explanation:
This stunning portrait of NGC 5335 was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.
 Some 170,000 light-years across and over 200 million light-years away toward the constellation Virgo, the magnificent spiral galaxy is seen face-on in Hubble's view.
Within the galactic disk, loose streamers of star forming regions lie along the galaxy's flocculent spiral arms.
But the most striking feature of NGC 5335 is its prominent central bar.
Seen in about 30 percent of galaxies, including our Milky Way, bar structures are understood to channel material inward toward the galactic center, fueling star formation.
Of course, distant background galaxies are easy to spot, scattered around the sharp Hubble image.

Main belt asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson is about 8 kilometers long and 3.5 kilometers across.
On April 20, this sharp close-up of the asteroid was captured at a distance of about 1100 kilometers by the Lucy spacecraft's long range camera during its second asteroid encounter.
Named after American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, discoverer of the Lucy hominid fossil, the elongated asteroid was likely formed about 150 million years ago from a gentle collision of two smaller bodies creating its characteristic contact binary shape.
Launched in October of 2021, the Lucy spacecraft will continue its travels through the main asteroid belt in 2025, but is on its way to explore Jupiter's swarm of Trojan asteroids.
Lucy is expected to encounter its first Trojan asteroid target, 3548 Eurybates, in August 2027..

Title: NGC 6164: A Dragon's Egg
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NGC_6164_r4_2048.jpg
Explanation:
Beautiful emission nebula NGC 6164 was created by a rare, hot, luminous O-type star, some 40 times as massive as the Sun.
Seen at the center of the cosmic cloud, the star is a mere 3 to 4 million years old.
In another three to four million years the massive star will end its life in a supernova explosion.
Spanning around 4 light-years, the nebula itself has a bipolar symmetry.
That makes it similar in appearance to more common and familiar planetary nebulae - the gaseous shrouds surrounding dying sun-like stars.
Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, faint halo, revealed in this deep image of the region.
Expanding into the surrounding interstellar medium, the material in the halo is likely from an earlier active phase of the O star.
This gorgeous telescopic view is a composite of extensive narrow-band image data, highlighting glowing atomic hydrogen gas in red and oxygen in greenish hues, with broad-band data for the surrounding starfield.
Also known as the Dragon's Egg nebula, NGC 6164 is 4,200 light-years away in the right-angled southern constellation of Norma..

 First, slanting down from the upper left and far in the distance is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.
 More modestly, slanting down from the upper right and high in Earth's atmosphere is a bright meteor.
The dim band of light across the central diagonal is zodiacal light: sunlight reflected from dust in the inner Solar System.
The green glow on the far right is aurora high in Earth's atmosphere.
 The bright zigzagging bright line near the bottom is just a light that was held by the scene-planning astrophotographer.

Explanation:
What's different about this Moon? It's the terminators.
In the featured image, you can't directly see any terminator -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night.
That's because the featured image is a digital composite of many near-terminator lunar strips over a full Moon.
 Terminator regions show the longest and most prominent shadows -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional.
The overlay images were taken over two weeks in early April.
 Many of the Moon's craters stand out because of the shadows they all cast to the right.
The image shows in graphic detail that the darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the Moon -- they are also flatter.

https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/GalaxiesLens_Webb_1146.jpg
Explanation:
Is this one galaxy or two? Although it looks like one, the answer is two.
One path to this happening is when a small galaxy collides with a larger galaxy and ends up in the center.
But in the featured image, something more rare is going on.
Here, the central light-colored elliptical galaxy is much closer than the blue and red-colored spiral galaxy that surrounds it.
This can happen when near and far galaxies are exactly aligned, causing the gravity of the near galaxy to pull the light from the far galaxy around it in an effect called gravitational lensing.
The featured galaxy double was taken by the Webb Space Telescope and shows a complete Einstein ring, with great detail visible for both galaxies.
 Galaxy lenses like this can reveal new information about the mass distribution of the foreground lens and the light distribution of the background source..

Explanation:
The Great Nebula in Orion is a colorful place.
 Visible to the unaided eye, it appears as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion.
 Long exposure, multi-wavelength images like this, however, show the Orion Nebula to be a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust.
 This digital composite features not only three colors of visible light but four colors of infrared light taken by NASA's orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope as well.
 The power behind much of the Orion Nebula (M42) is the Trapezium - four of the brightest stars in the nebula.
 Many of the filamentary structures visible are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.
 The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun..

In late March, the comet now designated C/2025 F2 SWAN was found independently by citizen scientists Vladimir Bezugly, Michael Mattiazzo, and Rob Matson while examining publicly available image data from the Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) camera on the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft.
Comet SWAN's coma, its greenish color a signature of diatomic carbon molecules fluorescing in sunlight, is at lower left in this telescopic image.
SWAN's faint ion tail extends nearly two degrees toward the upper right across the field of view.
The interplanetary scene was captured in clear but moonlit skies from June Lake, California on April 14.
Seen against background of stars toward the constellation Andromeda, the comet was then some 10 light-minutes from our fair planet.
Now a target for binoculars and small telescopes in northern hemisphere morning skies this comet SWAN is headed for a perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, on May 1.

Title: Halo of the Cat's Eye
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/CatsEyeWide_Niittee_960.jpg
Explanation:
What created the unusual halo around the Cat's Eye Nebula? No one is sure.
What is sure is that the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae on the sky.
 Although haunting symmetries are seen in the bright central region, this image was taken to feature its intricately structured outer halo, which spans over three light-years across.
 Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star.
Only recently however, have some planetaries been found to have expansive halos, likely formed from material shrugged off during earlier puzzling episodes in the star's evolution.
While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of the Cat's Eye Nebula's halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years..

Title: Planetary Nebula NGC 1514 from Webb
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/NGC1514_WebbSchmidt_1983.jpg
Explanation:
What happens when a star runs out of nuclear fuel?  For stars like our Sun, the center condenses into a white dwarf while the outer atmosphere is expelled into space to appear as a planetary nebula.
 The expelled outer atmosphere of planetary nebula NGC 1514 appears to be a jumble of bubbles -- when seen in visible light.
 But the view from the James Webb Space Telescope in infrared, as featured here, confirms a different story: in this light the nebula shows a distinct hourglass shape, which is interpreted as a cylinder seen along a diagonal.
 If you look closely at the center of the nebula, you can also see a bright central star that is part of a binary system.
 More observations might better reveal how this nebula is evolving and how the central stars are working together to produce the interesting cylinder and bubbles observed.

Explanation:
What's happening at the center of our galaxy? It's hard to tell with optical telescopes since visible light is blocked by intervening interstellar dust.
In other bands of light, though, such as radio, the galactic center can be imaged and shows itself to be quite an interesting and active place.
 The featured picture shows an image of our Milky Way's center by the MeerKAT array of 64 radio dishes in South Africa.
Spanning four times the angular size of the Moon (2 degrees), the image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed.
 Many known sources are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the galactic center is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.
 In our galaxy's center lies Sgr A, found here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.
 Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including the Arc, just to the left of Sgr A, and numerous filamentary threads.

Title: An Unusual Hole in Mars
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/MarsPit_mro_2628.jpg
Explanation:
What created this unusual hole in Mars? Actually, there are numerous holes pictured in this Swiss cheese-like landscape, with all-but-one of them showing a dusty, dark, Martian terrain beneath evaporating, light, carbon dioxide ice.
 The most unusual hole is on the upper right, spans about 100 meters, and seems to punch through to a lower level.
Why this hole exists and why it is surrounded by a circular crater remains a topic of speculation, although a leading hypothesis is that it was created by a meteor impact.
 Holes such as this are of particular interest because they might be portals to lower levels that extend into expansive underground caves.
If so, these naturally occurring tunnels are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life.
These pits are therefore also prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers..

Most of us watch the Moon at night.
But the Moon spends nearly as many daylight hours above our horizon, though in bright daytime skies the lunar disk looks pale and can be a little harder to see.
Of course in daytime skies the Moon also appears to cycle through its phases, shining by reflected sunlight as it orbits our fair planet.
For daytime moonwatchers, the Moon is probably easier to spot when the visible sunlit portion of the lunar disk is large and waxing following first quarter or waning approaching its third quarter phase.
And though it might look unusual, a daytime moon is often seen even in urban skies.

Title: 38 Hours with the M81 Group
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/38h_M81-group_Jpeg.jpeg
Explanation:
From a garden on planet Earth, 38 hours of exposure with a camera and small telescope produced this cosmic photo of the M81 galaxy group.
In fact, the group's dominant galaxy M81 is near the center of the frame sporting grand spiral arms and a bright yellow core.
Also known as Bode's galaxy, M81 itself spans some 100,000 light-years.
Near the top is cigar-shaped irregular galaxy M82.
 The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years.
Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters.
 Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in massive star forming regions arrayed along M81's spiral arms.
 M82 was left with violent star forming regions too, and colliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy glows in X-rays.
 In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain.
Another group member, NGC 3077 is below and left of the large spiral M81.
Far far away, about 12 million light-years distant the M81 group galaxies are seen toward the northern constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear).
But in the closer foreground the wide-field image is filled with integrated flux nebulae whose faint, dusty interstellar clouds reflect starlight above the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy..

Explanation:
What's at the tip of this interstellar jet?  First let's consider the jet: it is being expelled by a star system just forming and is cataloged as Herbig-Haro 49 (HH 49).
 The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.
 The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.
 The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.
 This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49's tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.
 The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.

Explanation:
Sometimes, the Moon visits the Pleiades.
Technically, this means that the orbit of our Moon takes it directly in front of the famous Pleiades star cluster, which is far in the distance.
 The technical term for the event is an occultation, and the Moon is famous for its rare occultations of all planets and several well-known bright stars.
The Moon's tilted and precessing orbit makes its occultations of the Seven Sisters star cluster bunchy, with the current epoch starting in 2023 continuing monthly until 2029.
After that, though, the next occultation won't occur until 2042.

Explanation:
How much mass do flocculent spirals hide?  The featured image of flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 4414 was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to help answer this question.
Flocculent spirals -- galaxies without well-defined spiral arms -- are a quite common form of galaxy, and NGC 4414 is one of the closest.
 Stars and gas near the visible edge of spiral galaxies orbit the center so fast that the gravity from a large amount of unseen dark matter must be present to hold them together.
 Understanding the matter and dark matter distribution of NGC 4414 helps humanity calibrate the rest of the galaxy and, by deduction, flocculent spirals in general.
 Further, calibrating the distance to NGC 4414 helps  humanity calibrate the cosmological distance scale of the entire  visible universe..

Why are there so many moonquakes?   Analyses of seismometers left on the moon during the Apollo moon landings reveal a surprising number of moonquakes occurring within 100 kilometers of the surface.
  In fact, 62 moonquakes were detected in data recorded between 1972 and 1977.
  Many of these moonquakes are not only strong enough to move furniture in a lunar apartment, but the stiff rock of the moon continues to vibrate for many minutes, significantly longer than the softer rock earthquakes on Earth.
  The cause of the moonquakes remains unknown, but a leading hypothesis includes tidal gravity from -- and relative heating by -- our Earth.
Regardless of the source, future moon dwellings need to be built to withstand the frequent shakings.

In dramatic silhouette against a cloudy daytime sky over Paris, France, gargoyles cast their monstrous gaze outward from the west facade of Notre Dame Cathedral.
 Taken on March 29, this telephoto snapshot also captures the dramatic silhouette of a New Moon against the bright solar disk in a partial solar eclipse.
Happening high in Parisian skies, the partial eclipse was close to its maximum phase of about 23 percent.
Occurring near the end of the first eclipse season of 2025, this partial solar eclipse followed the total eclipse of the Full Moon on March 13/14.
The upcoming second eclipse season of 2025 will see a total lunar eclipse on September 7/8 and partial solar eclipse on September 21.
The partial solar eclipse will be seen only from locations in planet Earth's southern hemisphere..

Title: Hickson 44 in Leo
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/ARP316.jpg
Explanation:
Scanning the skies for galaxies, Canadian astronomer Paul Hickson and colleagues identified some 100 compact groups of galaxies, now appropriately called Hickson Compact Groups.
The four prominent galaxies seen in this intriguing telescopic skyscape are one such group, Hickson 44.
The galaxy group is about 100 million light-years distant, far beyond the spiky foreground Milky Way stars, toward the constellation Leo.
The two spiral galaxies in the center of the image are edge-on NGC 3190 with its distinctive, warped dust lanes, and S-shaped NGC 3187.
Along with the bright elliptical, NGC 3193 (above and left) they are also known as Arp 316.
The spiral toward the lower right corner is NGC 3185, the 4th member of the Hickson group.
Like other galaxies in Hickson groups, these show signs of distortion and enhanced star formation, evidence of a gravitational tug of war that will eventually result in galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale.
The merger process is now understood to be a normal part of the evolution of galaxies, including our own Milky Way.
For scale, NGC 3190 is about 75,000 light-years across at the estimated distance of Hickson 44..

Explanation:
A 26 hour old Moon poses behind the craggy outline of the Italian Dolomites in this twilight mountain and skyscape.
The one second long exposure was captured near moonset on March 30.
And while only a a sliver of its sunlit surface is visible, most of the Moon's disk can be seen by earthshine as light reflected from a bright planet Earth illuminates the lunar nearside.
Also known as the Moon's ashen glow, a description of earthshine in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci.
Of course earthshine is just the most familiar example of planetshine, the faint illumination of the dark portion of a moon by light reflected from its planet..

Title: Jupiter and Ring in Infrared from Webb
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/JupiterRing_WebbSchmidt_2429.jpg
Explanation:
Why does Jupiter have rings?  Jupiter's main ring was discovered in 1979 by NASA's passing Voyager 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery.
 Data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that this ring was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons.
 As a small meteoroid strikes tiny Metis, for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a Jovian orbit.
The featured image of Jupiter in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope shows not only Jupiter and its clouds, but this ring as well.
Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter's large moon Europa -- in the center of diffraction spikes on the left, and Europa's shadow -- next to the GRS -- are also visible.
Several features in the image are not yet well understood, including the seemingly separated cloud layer on Jupiter's right limb.

Title: A Double Sunrise from a Partial Eclipse
https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTkbHJsqCZM?rel=0
Explanation:
Can the Sun appear to rise twice at the same time? This was just the case a few days ago from Les Escoumins, Quebec, Canada as our Solar System's bright central orb rose just as it was being partially eclipsed by the Moon.
The featured video shows this unusual double-sunrise in real time and being reflected by the St.
Lawrence River.
Soon after the initial two spots of light appear over distant clouds, what appears to be bright horns become visible -- which are really just parts of the Sun not being eclipsed.
Soon, the entire eclipsed Sun is visible above the horizon.
 In all, this broken sunrise took less than two minutes during a partial eclipse that lasted many times longer.
  Although the Moon circles the Earth once a month (moon-th), it does not always eclipse the Sun because its tilted orbit usually takes it above or below.

Title: A Partial Solar Eclipse over Iceland
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2504/PartialSolar_Gorecka_3453.jpg
Explanation:
What if the Sun and Moon rose together? That happened yesterday over some northern parts of planet Earth as a partial solar eclipse occurred shortly after sunrise.
Regions that experienced the Moon blocking part of the Sun included northeastern parts of North America and northwestern parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa.
 The featured image was captured yesterday over the Grábrók volcanic crater in Iceland where much of the Sun became momentarily hidden behind the Moon.
The image was taken through a cloudy sky but so well planned that the photographer's friend appeared to be pulling the Sun out from behind the Moon.
No part of the Earth experienced a total solar eclipse this time.
In the distant past, some of humanity was so surprised when an eclipse occurred that ongoing battles suddenly stopped.
 Today, eclipses are not a surprise and are predicted with an accuracy of seconds.

Title: Stereo Helene
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/N00172886_92_beltramini.jpg
Explanation:
Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn.
Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point.
A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione.
In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange point.
The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011.
It shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene mottled with craters and gully-like features.

Title: Lunar Dust and Duct Tape
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/AS17-137-20979.jpg
Explanation:
Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand.
On the Moon, eons of constant micrometeorite bombardment have blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.
 For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem.
On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover's fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear.
This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of "duct tape".

Title: Messier 81
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/291_lorand_fenyes_m81_kicsi.jpg
Explanation:
One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky is similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy: big, beautiful Messier 81.
Also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's galaxy for its 18th century discoverer, this grand spiral can be found toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.
The sharp, detailed telescopic view reveals M81's bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes.
But some dust lanes actually cut across the galactic disk (left of center), contrary to other prominent spiral features.
The errant dust lanes may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame.
Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded a well-determined distance for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years..

Title: Star Formation in the Pacman Nebula
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/Pacman_Montilla_1500.jpg
Explanation:
You'd think the Pacman Nebula would be eating stars, but actually it is forming them.
Within the nebula, a cluster's young, massive stars are powering the pervasive nebular glow.
The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars.
If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation.
Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia.
This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters in Spain in mid 2024.
It combines emissions from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors.
The scene spans well over 80 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 281..

Title: A Blue Banded Blood Moon
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/LunarEclipseColors_Jin_2700.jpg
Explanation:
What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see.
The featured HDR image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from Norman, Oklahoma (USA) -- has been digitally processed to exaggerate  the colors.
 The gray color on the upper right of the top lunar image is the Moon's natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight.
The lower parts of the Moon on all three images are not directly lit by the Sun since it is being eclipsed -- it is in the Earth's shadow.
It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through Earth's atmosphere.
This part of the Moon is red -- and called a blood Moon -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: because air scatters away more blue light than red.
The unusual purple-blue band visible on the upper right of the top and middle images is different -- its color is augmented by sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where red light is better absorbed by ozone than blue.

Title: A Total Lunar Eclipse Over Uruguay
unknown
Explanation:
If the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see? The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar eclipse last week from Uruguay.
During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the Moon to fade dramatically.
The Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth's atmosphere refracts some light.
As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon.
As the Moon becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible.
Most spectacularly, the sky surrounding the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be full of stars and highlighted by the busy plane of our Milky Way Galaxy.
Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the Moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky..

Explanation:
This was once a beach -- on ancient Mars.
The featured 360-degree panorama, horizontally compressed, was taken in 2017 by the robotic Curiosity rover that explored the red planet.
Named Ogunquit Beach after its terrestrial counterpart, evidence shows that at times long ago the area was underwater, while at other times it was at the edge of an ancient lake.
 The light peak in the central background is the top of Mount Sharp, the central feature in Gale Crater where Curiosity explored.
Portions of the dark sands in the foreground were  scooped up for analysis.
 The light colored bedrock is composed of sediment that likely settled at the bottom of the now-dried lakebed.
 The featured panorama (interactive version here) was created from over 100 images and seemingly signed by the rover on the lower left..

What's the sound of one laser zapping? There's no need to consult a Zen master to find out, just listen to the first acoustic recording of laser shots on Mars.
On Mars Rover Perseverance mission sol 12 (March 2, 2021) the SuperCam instrument atop the rover's mast zapped a rock dubbed Ma'az 30 times from a range of about 3.1 meters.
Its microphone recorded the soft staccato popping sounds of the rapid series of SuperCam laser zaps.
Shockwaves created in the thin Martian atmosphere as bits of rock are vaporized by the laser shots make the popping sounds, sounds that offer clues to the physical structure of the target.
This SuperCam close-up of the Ma'az target region is 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) across.

Explanation:
This popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March equinox and the northern hemisphere spring.
 Famous as the Leo Triplet, the three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent constellation Leo gather here in one astronomical field of view.
Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (bottom left), M66 (middle right), and M65 (top center).
All three are large spiral galaxies but tend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight.
NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across its puffy galactic plane.
The disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.
 Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and warped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66.
This gorgeous view of the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky.
Captured with a telescope from Sawda Natheel, Qatar, planet Earth, the frame covers over half a million light-years at the Leo Trio's estimated 30 million light-year distance..

Title: The Solar Eclipse Analemma Project
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/HunterWells_submission3-3.png
Explanation:
Recorded from 2024 March 10, to 2025 March 1, this composited series of images reveals a pattern in the seasonal drift of the Sun's daily motion through planet Earth's sky.
Known to some as an analemma, the figure-eight curve was captured in exposures taken on the indicated dates only at 18:38 UTC from the exact same location south of Stephenville, Texas.
The Sun's position on the 2024 solstice dates of June 20 and December 21 would be at the top and bottom of the curve and correspond to the astronomical beginning of summer and winter in the north.
Points that lie along the curve half-way between the solstices would mark the equinoxes.
The 2024 equinox on September 22, and in 2025 the equinox on March 20 (today) are the start of northern fall and spring.
And since one of the exposures was made on 2024 April 8 from the Stephenville location at 18:38:40 UTC, this analemma project also reveals the solar corona in planet Earth's sky during a total solar eclipse..

Title: Blue Ghost's Diamond Ring
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/eclipse-shot-from-blue-ghost-mission-1.jpg
Explanation:
On March 14 the Full Moon slid through Earth's dark umbral shadow and denizens of planet Earth were treated to a total lunar eclipse.
Of course, from the Moon's near side that same astronomical syzygy was seen as a solar eclipse.
Operating in the Mare Crisium on the lunar surface, the Blue Ghost lander captured this video frame of Earth in silhouette around 3:30am CDT, just as the Sun was emerging from behind the terrestrial disk.
From Blue Ghost's lunar perspective the beautiful diamond ring effect, familiar to earthbound solar eclipse watchers, is striking.
Since Earth appears about four times the apparent size of the Sun from the lunar surface the inner solar corona, the atmosphere of the Sun most easily seen from Earth during a total solar eclipse, is hidden from view.
Still, scattering in Earth's dense atmosphere creates the glowing band of sunlight embracing our fair planet..

Title: LDN 1235: The Shark Nebula
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/Shark_Martin_5441.jpg
Explanation:
There is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula.
This predator apparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and dust.
Dark dust like that featured here is somewhat like cigarette smoke and created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars.
After expelling gas and gravitationally recondensing, massive stars may carve intricate structures into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast stellar winds as sculpting tools.
 The heat they generate evaporates the murky molecular cloud as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.
 During disintegration, we humans can enjoy imagining these great clouds as common icons, like we do for water clouds on Earth.
Including smaller dust nebulae such as Van den Bergh 149 & 150, the Shark nebula, sometimes cataloged as LDN 1235,  spans about 15 light years and lies about 650 light years away toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus).

Explanation:
Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.
 Popularly called Thor's Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages.
Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across.
In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown by a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center.
Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution.
NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog.
This sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula's filamentary structures.
The star in the center of Thor's Helmet is expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime within the next few thousand years..

Title: Venus and the Triply Ultraviolet Sun
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/SunVenusUv3_SdoDove_960.jpg
Explanation:
This was a very unusual type of solar eclipse.
 Typically, it is the Earth's Moon that eclipses the Sun.
 In 2012, though, the planet Venus took a turn.
 Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun.
 Eventually the alignment became perfect and the phase of Venus dropped to zero.
 The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star.
 The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire.
 Pictured here during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole.
Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again.
 The next Venusian transit across the Sun will occur in 2117..

Explanation:
On March 14 the Moon was Full.
In an appropriate celebration of Pi day, that put the Moon 3.14 radians (180 degrees) in ecliptic longitude from the Sun in planet Earth's sky.
As a bonus for fans of Pi and the night sky, on that date the Moon also passed directly through Earth's umbral shadow in a total lunar eclipse.
In clear skies, the colors of an eclipsed Moon can be vivid.
Reflecting the deeply reddened sunlight scattered into Earth's shadow, the darkened lunar disk was recorded in this time series composite image from Cerro Tololo Observatory, Chile.
The lunar triptych captures the start, middle, and end of the total eclipse phase that lasted about an hour.
A faint bluish tint seen just along the brighter lunar limb at the shadow's edge is due to sunlight filtered through Earth's stratospheric ozone layer.

Explanation:
What phase of the Moon is 3.14 radians from the Sun? The Full Moon, of course.
Even though the Moon might look full for several days, the Moon is truly at its full phase when it is Pi radians (aka 180 degrees) from the Sun in ecliptic longitude.
That's opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky.
Rising as the Sun set on March 9, 2020, only an hour or so after the moment of its full phase, this orange tinted and slightly flattened Moon still looked full.
It was photographed opposite the setting Sun from Teide National Park on the Canary Island of Tenerife.
Also opposite the setting Sun, seen from near the Teide volcano peak about 3,500 meters above sea level, is the mountain's rising triangular shadow extending into Earth's dense atmosphere.
Below the distant ridge line on the left are the white telescope domes of Teide Observatory.
Today, March 14 2025, the moon is Pi radians from the Sun at exactly 06:55 UTC.
That's about three minutes before the midpoint of the March Full Moon's total lunar eclipse..

Two protostars are hidden in a single pixel near the center of a striking hourglass-shaped nebula in this near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope.
The actively forming star system lies in a dusty molecular cloud cataloged as Lynds 483, some 650 light-years distant toward the constellation Serpens Cauda.

https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/NGC772Comet_Bax_4724.jpg
Explanation:
Why does this galaxy look like a curly vegetable?  The Fiddlehead spiral galaxy likely gets its distorted spiral appearance from a gravitational interaction with its close-by elliptical companion NGC 770, seen just below.
 Cataloged as NGC 772 and Arp 78, the Fiddlehead spans over 200,000 light years, is a nearby 100 million light years beyond the stars of our Milky Way galaxy, and is visible toward the constellation of the Ram (Aries).
 But in the featured image, the Fiddlehead appears to have another companion -- one with a long and fuzzy tail: Comet 43P/Wolf-Harrington.
 Though the comet appears to be aimed straight at the massive galaxy, it is actually much closer to us, residing only light minutes away -- well within our Solar System.
 The comet will never reach the distant spiral galaxy, nor is it physically related to it.
 By a fortunate trick of perspective, though, these two cosmic wonders briefly share the same frame taken late last year from Calern, France..

 Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar.
Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.
Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.
 Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which spans about 75,000 light years across.

Could Queen Calafia's mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of California, USA.
Our Sun has its home within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,000 light-years from the California Nebula.
Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long.
On the featured image, the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight.
The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.

Explanation:
Why are there so many cyclones around the north pole of Jupiter? The topic is still being researched.
 NASA's robotic Juno mission orbiting Jupiter took data in 2018 that was used to construct this stunning view of the curious cyclones at Jupiter's north pole.
Measuring the thermal emission from Jovian cloud tops, the infrared observations are not restricted to the hemisphere illuminated by sunlight.
They reveal eight cyclonic features that surround a cyclone about 4,000 kilometers in diameter, just offset from the giant planet's geographic north pole.
Similar data show a cyclone at the Jovian south pole with five circumpolar cyclones.
The south pole cyclones are slightly larger than their northern cousins.
Oddly, data from the once Saturn-orbiting Cassini mission has shown that Saturn's north and south poles each have only a single cyclonic storm system..

Very faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is about 1,800 light-years distant.
It lies just south of Orion in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation Lepus, The Hare.
Surrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to distant background galaxies its generally simple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is revealed in this deep telescopic image.
Within the cosmic cloud are beautiful and complex structures though, enhanced by the use of long exposures and narrowband filters that capture emission from hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms.
Otherwise Abell 7 would be much too faint to be appreciated by eye.
A planetary nebula represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion years hence, as the nebula's central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers.
Abell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old.
But its central star, seen here as a fading white dwarf, is some 10 billion years old..

Title: Starburst Galaxy Messier 94
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/M94_hst1542a_1280.jpg
Explanation:
Beautiful island universe Messier 94 lies a mere 15 million light-years distant in the northern constellation of the hunting dogs, Canes Venatici.
A popular target for earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the outskirts of its broad disk.
But this Hubble Space Telescope field of view spans about 7,000 light-years or so across M94's central region.
The sharp close-up examines the galaxy's compact, bright nucleus and prominent inner dust lanes, surrounded by a remarkable bluish ring of young, massive stars.
The massive stars in the ring appear to be less than about 10 million years old, indicating the galaxy experienced a corresponding well-defined era of rapid star formation.
As a result, while the small, bright nucleus is typical of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, M94 is also known as a starburst galaxy.
Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can explore in detail reasons for the galaxy's burst of star formation.

Title: Seven Sisters versus California
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/California2Pleiades_Anderson_9953.jpg
Explanation:
On the right, dressed in blue, is the Pleiades.
 Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and most easily visible open clusters on the sky.
The Pleiades contains over 3,000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across.
Surrounding the stars is a spectacular blue reflection nebula made of fine dust.
 A common legend is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named.
On the left, shining in red, is the California Nebula.
 Named for its shape, the California Nebula is much dimmer and hence harder to see than the Pleiades.
 Also known as NGC 1499, this mass of red glowing hydrogen gas is about 1,500 light years away.
Although about 25 full moons could fit between them, the featured wide angle, deep field image composite has captured them both.
 A careful inspection of the deep image will also reveal the star forming region IC 348 and the molecular cloud LBN 777 (the Baby Eagle Nebula).

Title: A Quadruple Alignment over Italy
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/QuadMoon_Minato_960.jpg
Explanation:
Why does this Moon look so unusual?  A key reason is its vivid red color.
The color is caused by the deflection of blue light by Earth's atmosphere -- the same reason that the daytime sky appears blue.
 The Moon also appears unusually distorted.
 Its strange structuring is an optical effect arising from layers in the Earth's atmosphere that refract light differently due to sudden differences in temperature or pressure.
 A third reason the Moon looks so unusual is that there is, by chance, an airplane flying in front.
The featured picturesque gibbous Moon was captured about two weeks ago above Turin, Italy.
Our familiar hovering sky orb was part of an unusual quadruple alignment that included two historic ground structures: the Sacra di San Michele on the near hill and Basilica of Superga just beyond.

Title: Blue Ghost on the Moon
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/BlueGhostShadow_Firefly_4096.jpg
Explanation:
There's a new lander on the Moon.
Yesterday Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost executed the first-ever successful commercial lunar landing.
During its planned 60-day mission, Blue Ghost will deploy several NASA-commissioned scientific instruments, including PlanetVac which captures lunar dust after creating a small whirlwind of gas.
Blue Ghost will also host the telescope LEXI that captures X-ray images of the Earth's magnetosphere.
LEXI data should enable a better understanding of how Earth's magnetic field protects the Earth from the Sun's wind and flares.
 Pictured, the shadow of the Blue Ghost lander is visible on the cratered lunar surface, while the glowing orb of the planet Earth hovers just over the horizon.
Goals for future robotic Blue Ghost landers include supporting lunar astronauts in NASA's Artemis program, with Artemis III currently scheduled to land humans back on the Moon in 2027..

Title: The Hubble Ultra Deep Field in Light and Sound
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1803/AstroSoM/hudf.html
Explanation:
Have you heard about the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field?  Either way, you've likely not heard about it like this -- please run your cursor over the featured image and listen!  The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the Hubble Space Telescope staring for a long time toward near-empty space so that distant, faint galaxies would become visible.
 One of the most famous images in astronomy, the HUDF is featured here in a vibrant way -- with sonified distances.
Pointing to a galaxy will play a note that indicates its approximate redshift.
Because redshifts shift light toward the red end of the spectrum of light, they are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the spectrum of sound.
 The further the galaxy, the greater its cosmological redshift (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played.
The average galaxy in the HUDF is about 10.6 billion light years away and sounds like an F#.

Title: Blue Ghost to the Moon
https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2503/BlueGhost_lunar1067.jpg
Explanation:
With spacecraft thrusters at top center, the rugged surface of the Moon lies below the Blue Ghost lander in this space age video frame.
The view of the lunar far side was captured by the Firefly Aerospace lunar lander on February 24, following a maneuver to circularize its orbit about 100 kilometers above the lunar surface.
The robotic lunar lander is scheduled to touch down tomorrow, Sunday, March 2, at 3:34am Eastern Time in the Mare Crisium impact basin on the lunar near side.
In support of the Artemis campaign, Blue Ghost is set to deliver science and technology experiments to the Moon, part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.
Blue Ghost's mission on the surface is planned to operate during the lunar daylight hours at the landing site, about 14 Earth days..
